JavaScript provide a variety of built-in array methods that allow you to manipulate and interact with arrays. Here are some of the most commonly used array methods:

## Mutator Methods

These methods modify the array itself.

1. `push()`: Adds one of more elements to the end of an array.
2. `pop()`: Removes the last element from an array.
3. `shift()`: Removes the first element from an array.
4. `unshift()`: Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array.
5. `splice()`: Adds or removes elements from an array.
6. `sort()`: Sorts the elements of an array.
7. `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the elements in an array.
8. `fill()`: Fills all the elements of an array from a start index to an end index with a static value.
9. `copyWithin()`: Copies a sequence of array elements within the array.

## Accessor Methods

These methods do not modify the array but return some representation of the array.

1. `concat()`: Merges two or more arrays.
2. `slice()`: Returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array.
3. `includes()`: Determine whether an array includes a certain value.
4. `indexOf()`: Returns the first index at which a given element can be found.
5. `lastIndexOf()`: Returns the last index at which a given element can be found.
6. `join()`: Joins all elements of an array into a string.
7. `toString()`: Returns a string representing the array.
8. `toLocalString()`: Returns a localized string representing the array.

## Iteration Methods

These methods are used to iterate over arrays.

1. `forEach()`: Executes a provided function once for each array element.
2. `map()`: Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided funtion on every element.
3. `filter()`: Creates a new array with all the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
4. `reduce()`: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element to reduce it to a single value.
5. `reduceRight()`: Applies a function against an accumulator and each element (from right to left) to reduce it to a single value.
6. `some()`: Tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
7. `every()`: Tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function.
8. `find()`: Returns the first element that satisfies the provided testing function.
9. `findIndex()`: Returns the index of the first element that satisfies the provided testing function.
10. `entries()`: Returns a new Array Iterator object that contains the keys for each index.
11. `keys()`: Returns a new Array Iterator object that contains the keys for each index.
12. `values()`: Returns a new Array Iterator object that contains the values for each index.
