Some aspects to focus on when testing React components include:

- **Rendering:** Verify that the component renders correctly under different conditions.
- **Props:** Test how the component behaves when you pass different props.
- **User Interaction:** Simulate user interactions and verify that the component behaves correctly.
- **State:** If the component has internal state, test how the component behaves when the state changes.
- **Hooks:** If the component has hooks, like `useEffect`, test that they are called when expected and that they have the correct side effects.
- **Context:** If the component uses React context, test how the component behaves with different context values.
- **State Management Libraries** If the component is connected to a state management library store, test how the component behaves when the store's state changes.
