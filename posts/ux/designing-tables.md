## Lighten borders

Everything should should be visible in proportion to it's importance in design. Borders are of minimal importance, so keep them light.

## Combine similar fields

To help condense the size of tables, combine thematically similar fields. Also remove irrelevant fields.

## Never use naked colored text

Instead of naked colored text, try a tag treatment.

## Combine sparesly-populated columns

Combine columns where the majority of entries have a blank value.

## Make numbers right-aligned and monospace

Right-aligned and monospace numbers are easier to compare digit-for-digit. You will also be able to instantly compare numbers by length.
