React Native is a framework developed by Facebook that allows developers to build cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase.

A high-level overview of how React Native:

1. JavaScript and React: React Native uses JavaScript and the React library to build user interfaces.

2. Native Components: React Native provides a set of built-in components that map directly to the native UI components of iOS and Android platforms.

3. Bridge: React Native enables communication between JavaScript and the native code using a `bridge`. It operates asynchronously.

4. Native Modules: When functionality is not covered by React Native's built-in components, writing native modules in Objective-C, Swift, Java, or Kotlin allows you to extend functionality to the native platforms (iOS and Android).

5. Flexbox Layout: To make it easier to create responsive UIs that work for different screen sizes, React Native uses Flexbox for layouts.

6. Hot Reloading: To allow developers to see changes made in the code immediately without having to recompile the application, React Native supports hot reloading.
