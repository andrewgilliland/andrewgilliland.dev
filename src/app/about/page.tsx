            I&apos;m a self-taught full stack developer who loves building tools
            to solve business problems. I believe development is a team sport
            and thrive in collaborative environments that encourage creative
            growthâ€”after all, the best ideas can come from anyone. My mission is
            to help teams create exceptional web and mobile applications that
            reach their full potential.

            I thrive on building engaging and interactive user experiences and
            am comfortable working in both front-end and back-end development.
            For mobile applications, I prefer working with TypeScript, React
            Native, and Expo. For web applications, my go-to tools are
            TypeScript, React, and Next.js. I&apos;m always eager to learn and
            work with new technologies.

            Outside of programming, I love fitness, exercise, and nutrition.
            Having worked as a personal trainer for several years, I thoroughly
            enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. My other interests include
            woodworking, reading, drawing, grilling, and tackling various home
            projects. When it&apos;s time to relax, you&apos;ll find me hanging
            out with my dog Hank, my cats Gus and Bernie, while enjoying some
            Yacht Rock.
