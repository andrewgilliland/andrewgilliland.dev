## The Roolout

- The New Architecture is now enabled by default for all new projects.
- Projects that are upgrading from a previous version of the SDK can opt in to the New Architecture
- Expo Go for SDK 52 and higher will only support the New Architecture.

## Testing

- Ensure that you use the latest version of all third-party native libraries.
- Run `npx expo-doctor@latest` in your SDK 52 project to find any library incompatibilities that may cause issues when migrating.
