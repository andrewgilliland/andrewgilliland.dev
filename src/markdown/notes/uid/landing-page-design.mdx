## Improve Legibility Subtly

If text is overlayed onto images, use a technique to make the text more visibile. Try using a **scrim**, a subtle oval "shadow" behind the text.

## Good imagery is a cheat code

1. Use great **fonts**
2. Use great **imagery**

## Cherish your meta-text

Treat every piece of meta-text as an opportunity for visual interest.

What's meta-text?

- Bullet points
- Numbered lists
- Dashes
- Quotation marks

## For a completx brand, pull multiple levers

Convey different adjectives using different "levers" of brand:

- Color
- Typography
- Imagery
