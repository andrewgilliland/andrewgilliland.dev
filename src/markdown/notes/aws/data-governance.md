## What is Data Governance?

Data governance is the process of managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of the data used in an organization. It involves establishing policies, procedures, and standards to ensure data is accurate, consistent, and used responsibly. Effective data governance helps organizations make better decisions, comply with regulations, and protect sensitive information. The following tools from AWS help organizations achieve data governance:
