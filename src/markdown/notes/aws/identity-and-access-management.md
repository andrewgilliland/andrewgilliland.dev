## What is IAM (Identity and Access Management)

- Core AWS Service that helps you control access to **Resources**
- **Resources** are the entities you create in AWS i.e. S3 Bucket or Object
- Users attempt to perform **Actions** on resources, i.e. S3::CreateBucket
- Authorization to perform **Action** depends on a **Policy**
