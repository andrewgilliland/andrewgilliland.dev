## Why Write Tests

Why write tests? They take time and effort. Here are a few reasons:

- Catch bugs earlier
- Refactor code with confidence

This is faster than manually testing every feature any time you update your code.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

Code that tests a small unit of an application. That unit can be a function, a module, or a component.

### Integration Tests

Code that tests multiple units together.

### End-to-end Tests

Test the application like a real user, but in an automated fashion.
