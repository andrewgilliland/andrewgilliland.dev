This is my audit for the year of 2019 and what I have learned in web development. This is not a brag article, but rather to share the resources where I learned and my opinions on them. Hopefully, someone who is interested in learning a topic will read this, and be pointed in the right direction. The topics go chronologically in the order I learned them.

### JavaScript

    As a web developer, learning JavaScript is fundamental. I'd had some experience from the year prior. I took a course through Codecademy and Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy. I would definitely recommend Colt Steele's course. It is a great place to get your foot in the door and learn about a lot of topics in web development. I found Jonas Schmedtmann's course the Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy. This course gets a lot deeper in JS concepts and Jonas gives great explaination to coding practices.

### HTML

    Codecademy and The Web Development Bootcamp teaches HTML, but I wanted to learn more. Jonas's HTML5 and CSS3 course on Udemy goes over the basics. It is a good refresher to brush up on HTML5.

### CSS

    Jonas's HTML5 and CSS3 course gets into responsive design and flex box using CSS3. The Web Development Bootcamp covered these subjects as well. But it is great for more practice.
